[As a woman going into technology](http://www.anniehedgie.com/introduction) in my mid-thirties having had no prior experience, I've given a lot of thought to the many things that keep women from entering into a career in IT. The more I think about it, the more I respect the women who are already there. I think of them as free-thinkers and trailblazers because there are myriad of things working against them that they had to overcome to even realize a career in technology. 

So maybe you're not a woman in her mid-thirties; why do you need to know what those barriers are? Do you work in technology? Do you hire people in technology? Are you a parent? Do you know women? Do you know kids? 

If you answered yes to any of those questions, then I personally think it's important for you to be aware of the barriers. Why? 
 - Because it's a cultural problem. 
 - Because every industry is an IT industry today. 
 - Because if women on the whole don't have IT skills, they are not going to be making as much money as men.
 - And because [diversity will move technology forward](http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/scottepage/wp-content/uploads/sites/344/2015/11/pnas.pdf).

So what keeps women out of IT:
1. **Perfectionism.**
Linda Rising gives a GREAT talk called [The Power of an Agile Mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W47rcJowx7k) (37:00 in), and she talks about how little girls are praised for being "good" and "perfect" because they're not as disruptive as boys. Later, when they get older and face challenges (like [STEM](http://www.ed.gov/stem) topics), they freak out (very generally speaking, of course) because they can't be perfect and please their teachers, so they shy away from things that are challenging. Boys, on the other hand, are used to being corrected and in trouble more, so when they face the challenges of tough school material, they push through. 
**Solution:** Raise children with an agile (not fixed) mindset - the idea that anyone can learn! Struggle is opportunity.

2. **Moms.** 
Young girls get their first examples of what it means to be a woman, naturally, from their mothers. When we, as mothers, give technology (or [STEM](http://www.ed.gov/stem) in general) a reputation of being a man's thing, then voila - you have girls with that attitude.
**Solution:** Let's show our girls that we can do challenging stuff, too. I don't have girls, but in my task of raising 3 white males, I've always tried to challenge their perceptions of what a woman is by doing stereotypically male stuff around the house - building furniture, fixing stuff, learning technology, etc. - in hopes of ending more and more gender biases in the next generation. 

3. **Thinking we have to know everything about everything**
 Sheryl Sandberg, one of my heroes, wrote about this in her book [Lean In](http://leanin.org/book/) and gave a great [TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/sheryl_sandberg_why_we_have_too_few_women_leaders?language=en) about this urging women to “Sit at the Table” (in reference to how she noticed female colleagues sitting off to the side in big board meetings instead of at the table). She mentions studies that show that men slightly *overestimate* their own abilities and attribute their success to themselves while women slightly *underestimate* their abilities and attribute their success to luck, help, or hard work. She also mentions that men will apply for a job if they feel they're 60% qualified while women will only apply if they feel 100% qualified. 
 **Solution:** Just go for it. This 60% number stuck with me. I reminded myself, first of all,that no one knows everything about everything. And secondly, the desire to learn is the most important skill that anyone can have for any career. So with willingness to learn and work hard, then just about anyone can get to 60% qualified for an entry level IT job. 
 
 4. **IT Culture**
 Let's face it. There is a definite IT culture in America. And gererally speaking, I don't fit into it. 
  - I'm not male.
  - I like wine more than beer.
  - I don't have a beard.
  - I don't play video games or watch TV.
  - I don't wear the term "nerd" as a badge of honor.
  - I prefer dressing up to dressing down.
  - Sitting all day is not my thing. 

 
Often, our best work happens when we’re in a situation we wouldn’t have chosen for ourselves. The hard part is choosing to be in that sort of situation in the first place, the uncomfortable one where we have no choice but to do better work.
