The very first time I met Fletcher Nichol at a ChefConf I thanked him for creating [Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci/) because it was an integral tool that lowered the barrier to entry into technology for me. I have never written about it because I figured that _everyone_ was already using it anyway, so it there wasn't much to say. After being in the industry for a little while now, however, I'm really pretty surprised that it's not as common as it should be. When I take a look at a client's cookbooks for the first time and don't see a `.kitchen.yml` I'm honestly a little excited because that means that I get to introduce it to them and they're going to love me for it!
