I took the Basic Chef Fluency test a few months ago now, and a lot of people have asked about a study guide. While there are a lot of courses out there, there's little in the way of a simple study guide. Chef has a pdf of the things that you need to know for the exam, and when I was studying for the exam, I wrote out bullets for each of those points. And now I'm sharing them with you! 

I've created this [BASIC CHEF FLUENCY STUDY GUIDE](https://github.com/anniehedgpeth/basic-chef-fluency-study-guide) repo, and it's meant for community consumption, so please...consume! 

The [README](https://github.com/anniehedgpeth/basic-chef-fluency-study-guide/blob/master/README.md) has instructions on how to use the guide, but it's pretty simple. There are three files in the guide:

### [Basic Chef Fluency Study Guide](https://github.com/anniehedgpeth/basic-chef-fluency-study-guide/blob/master/basic-chef-fluency-study-sheet.md)
  - This is meant to study the concepts outlined in the [scope PDF](https://training.chef.io/static/Basic_Chef_Fluency_Badge_Scope.pdf) by Chef.

### [Basic Chef Fluency Kata](https://github.com/anniehedgpeth/basic-chef-fluency-study-guide/blob/master/basic-chef-fluency-kata.md)
  - This is an exercise guide meant for daily use. This guide is most effective for those that are not currently using Chef in their daily practice or are just starting in Chef. It will give you a comfort with Chef enough for navigating the topics of the exam.

### [Basic Chef Fluency Kata Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/anniehedgpeth/basic-chef-fluency-study-guide/blob/master/basic-chef-fluency-kata-cheatsheet.md)
  - This is used in conjunction with the Basic Chef Fluency Kata. If you are uncertain about how to carry out an exercise, then you can consult the cheat sheet.

If you have improvements that can be made to this guide, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/anniehedgpeth/basic-chef-fluency-study-guide/pulls) or [issue](https://github.com/anniehedgpeth/basic-chef-fluency-study-guide/issues)!

Good luck on your [exam](https://training.chef.io/basic-chef-fluency-badge)!
