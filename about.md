I can't shake that feeling like I just walked into the men's restroom. It's not because it's [mostly men in technology](http://martinfowler.com/articles/born-for-it.html) (well, a little), but it's because I don't know how I got here and if I should exit quickly before making eye contact with anyone. 

I have a BFA in Film, a minor in Theatre, and I worked as a Casting Director before leaving full-time employment for more flexible endeavors while I was raising babies. I did some blogging, and I had a home decorating business. 

[I was ready to go back to full-time employment](http://leanin.org/book/), but I also wanted a career change. The obvious career path for someone with my skill-set was probably HR or Marketing, and I get that. But here's the catch - I didn't want that. 

I wanted to take the soft skills that I had gained through my creative pursuits and apply them to technology. I didn't feel like I could contribute something original in my former pursuits, so I wanted to learn to create at a level that I haven't yet experienced.

The purpose of this blog is to share what I'm learning from a series of small projects. I'm taking baby steps to get to where I want to be, but [I'm excited about the process](https://youtu.be/C13JC_YP2Q8). 

When I first started learning how to speak French the biggest hurdle was just getting out there and speaking it with people without being embarrassed. If I didn't humble myself in that way, then I would have never improved. I made a ton of mistakes (and am still not totally fluent), but I have finally learned to not be embarrassed. 

This website for me is like speaking horribly broken French to native Parisians. It's a little embarrassing, but I'm hoping that the upside will be lots of growth and understanding.
